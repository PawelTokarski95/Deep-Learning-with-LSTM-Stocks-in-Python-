# Deep-Learning-with-LSTM-Stocks-in-Python-

The purpose of this project was to create an LSTM model based on economic data from financial markets, including:

-Oil
-Inflation
-Bonds
-Developed markets index, based on the ETF called "MSCI US"
These were the features, meaning they helped predict the target variable (y_value), which represents small companies based on the ETF index called "IWM".

What is LSTM? It is a deep learning model that takes into account previous time-series data, adjusting information based on it. This process allows the LSTM neural network model to detect long-term dependencies and forget them if necessary, while also considering short-term data. It is an important model, especially for tasks such as predicting stock prices, which is the goal of this project.
